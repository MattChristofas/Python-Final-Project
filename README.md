## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
IDEA #1: Choose your own story game. This prompts the user to answer questions that will change their story outcomes.
IDEA #2: Tic-Tac-Toe game

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
Working alone, I'm pretty certain that I'm going to do a choose your own story game. I would like to have full creative control over what happens within the story and the different paths within the game.

Will we have any in class time to work on the final project?
