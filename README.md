# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
IDEA #1: Choose your own story game. This prompts the user to answer questions that will change their story outcomes.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
Working alone, I'm pretty certain that I'm going to do a choose your own story game. I would like to have full creative control over what happens within the story and the different paths within the game.
## Do you have any questions of your own?
Will we have any in class time to work on the final project?



# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
The Ultimate Minecraft Story Adventure


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An interactive text game that lets the user make choices that cause changes throughout the narrative of the game.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will be a text based game that provides the user with a narrative and allows them to make choices along the way. The choices will be predetermined and the user will enter numbers that correspond with different actions or simple text inputs such as "left" or "right" for example. The code will be executed using a series of functions, and mostly if statements and else statements.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A minecraft based storyline game that asks the player at least 5 different questions that lead to a few different endings. When the player chooses the incorrect choice, the game will prompt the player to play again. The games total run time to explore all of the different choices should be about 3 minutes or more.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A minecraft based storyline game that asks the player at least 10 different questions that lead to more than 5 possible endings. The choices that the player makes early in the storyline will provide more choices later on in the game and help them reach better endings.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A minecraft based storyline game that allows the player lots of variety in choices and endings. The storyline will be well developed and very detailed. Also, the choices made early in the game will be more important in getting a better ending to the story.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps are to begin brainstorming the storyline, actually begin the coding, and then decide when to implement different choices into the storyline and how those decisions will impact the outcome of the game.


# Status Report

Write out the endings and decide how earlier decisions will affect endings. Create a user prompt to restart the game.

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have written the majority of the storyline and have implemented a few different decisions for the player. I am starting to work on developing the different endings and how they will unfold.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Need to finish the different endings and figure out how the earlier decisions can have more importance by the end of the story. Also, I need to create a user prompt to restart the game.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

It hasn't been as easy as I had expected it to be in trying to program how the different decisions will impact the endings.
